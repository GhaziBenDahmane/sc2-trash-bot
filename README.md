# SC2 TRASH BOT

Trash-bot is probably the worst Starcraft 2 you'll ever meet but at least it has some character to it and a sweet personality.
Its ruthless strategy allows it to defeat formidable,distinguished and clearly in a good shape opponents like the computer easy bot and sometimes the medium one.

## Getting Started

To wreck every bot in the galaxy you'll first need to clone this repository (lol)

```
git clone git@github.com:GhaziBenDahmen/sc2-trash-bot.git
```

You'll need Python 3.6 .
then install the only requirement using 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


You'll also need an StarCraft II executable. If you are running Windows or macOS, just install the normal SC2 from blizzard app. [The free starter edition works too.](https://us.battle.net/account/sc2/starter-edition/). Linux users must use the [Linux binary](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#downloads).

You probably want some maps too. Official map downloads are available from [Blizzard/s2client-proto](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#downloads). Notice: the map files are to be extracted into *subdirectories* of the `install-dir/Maps` directory.

and get started using :

```
python3 run_locally.py
```

### Prerequisites

You'll need atleast 400 apm in order to execute this bot as well as i do , you need to master the ins and outs of the game and you definitely need to atleast be able to defeat the formible medium bot atleast 25% of the time.

Also knowledge in python could help.



### And coding style tests

Respect Python coding conventions and
Just DO NOT use CamelCase , please.
